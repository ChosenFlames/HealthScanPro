# Health-Scan Pro

Health-Scan Pro is a web application designed to assist healthcare professionals in analyzing lab test results. By uploading lab test images, the application extracts text from the images and generates detailed recommendations based on the extracted information.

## Features

The application allows users to upload lab test images and extract text from them using Tesseract OCR. It then generates comprehensive recommendations using the Anthropic API powered by Claude 3 Opus AI. The web interface is user-friendly and works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.

2. Upload a lab test image using the provided file upload input.
3. Wait for the application to process the image and generate recommendations.
